# Get Set Shapes

Create a class called `Rectangle` that has a constructor method that takes two arguments: `width` and `height`. It should have getters for width and height, and a method called `getArea()` that calculates and returns the area of the rectangle. Create a subclass called `Square` that extends the Rectangle class. Add a method to the Square class called `getPerimeter()` that calculates and returns the perimeter of the square.
